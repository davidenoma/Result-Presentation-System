This system allows Lecturers, HODs and Deans to upload and view students' results. The 
key technologies used in this platform
are JSP, Java EE6, JDBC, APACHE POI API, MYSQL, HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT and file mangagement. 
There are databases for different programs, courses and levels with different levels of control for 
lecturer(at course level), HOD (at department level) and Dean (at college level). 
This also allows them to create powerpoint slides with the use of apache poi api from html data.
